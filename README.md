# Sportal
This is a redacted version of the Sportal code base.

## Backend
The backend is implemented with django.

## Frontend
The frontend is implemented with flutter. I had originally started with react but found that I quite enjoy dartlang.

# Parser
The parsers play a crucial role in getting the app to work. They convert a sport API into an interface the backend can consume. The parsers will poll at certain intervals (depending on the sport) to update the backed.
